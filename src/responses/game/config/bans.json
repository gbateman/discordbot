	"reasons": {
		"Aer'dak": [
			"It's very easy with effects like Xelfe and Bi-Mowercycle to give 4-6 of your opponent's creatures range. Letting you win the game for 10 Mugic Counters. At most, this can take a couple of combats to happen, but some variants can win before the first combat.",
			"She can one shot a deck, but still uses a spear"
		],
		"Aszil, The Young Queen": [
			"She consistently gives her tribe earth. Removing the deck building restrictions of synergizing elements on creatures, without the downside of gear that grants elements or playing Mugic or abilities to give Earth. In addition, by having Hive active, your Mandiblors have Outperform Courage 5. She's purely value with no reason not to include her in an earth/courage deck. Other creatures that give resources have a cost."
		],
		"AZAIA Mindscrying Chamber": [
			"There's a lot of ways to remove elements. But this card's unilateral destruction of elements all but ensures a win for a discipline deck. You can't react to this one. It triggers on reveal, so location negating doesn't stop it. It's far reaching effect goes beyond a single Creature, paralizing other cards that rely on expending."
		],
		"Before the Storm": [
			"This attack provides Strike Decks a second strike. You'd see ~55 damage. Although not extraordinary damage, since Mipedians also have access to cycling cards like Meditative Leap, Blaze Barrage and Synaptic Acceleration."
		],
		"Bi-Mowercycle": [
			"This card is very meta warping, there are very few Battlegear that can go on support creatures and Bi-Mowercycle is the most consistently good. Bi-Mowercycle allows you to give any Creature Range and Swift without hindering their Battlegear choice. This results in it appearing in a lot of decks. Which means you almost always need to include Defender, since defenders aren't ubiquitous, this hinders deck variety.",
			"Zoom"
		],
		"Bodal, Flamedrill Researcher": [
			"Mostly due to his Expend Earth ability, there are a couple powerful combos. But the most potent is an combo involving Olkiex, Scout's Monocular, Lam'inkal, and Destructozooka (and Droskin).",
			"Recycles battlegear better than Kybon's Scrapyard."
		],
		"Cadence Clash": [
			"Cadence Clash became a necessary card. To play a Mugic, you'd have to run two Cadence Clashes just to counter your opponent's two Cadence Clashes. When using Clash on a Clash, it returns to their hand, so now they can Clash the next Mugic you play too.",
			"They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy\nFun, fun, fun, fun, fun!"
		],
		"Casters' Warsong": [
			"In pauper, the availability of this Mugic gives advantage to the prevailant \"burn\" archtypes and can be a filler card in already good decks with a Muge (eg. Danian compost)."
		],
		"Deadwater Devastation": [
			"It can severely hinder your opponent's Mugic abilty. Since most decks don't have ample Mugic counters, playing Deadwater early game cripples their options."
		],
		"Dror'niq": [
			"His first ability allows him to deal 10 damage for 1 Mugic Counter, and when he's stored up enough counters, he can one-shot opposing engaged Creatures.\nAlthough his second ability takes 4 Mugic Counters, he can use it while unengaged and it essentially provides Recklessness 10 for 30-50 damage in a typical combat.",
			"One shot, one code."
		],
		"Elemental Denial": [
			"Its splashable inclusion in Mixed decks allows an easy way to surpress opponents playstyle with limited cost to their own deck."
		],
		"Elemental Elegy": [
			"This card allows Danains to shoot down elemental attacks, which can guarantee a combat win if the opposing creature doesn't have a way to gain elements. Against non-elemental Creatures, it becomes a \"Song of Stasis\" to stall the attack of a Creature. Because of its dual nature, it provides too much advantage.",
			"Danians plagiarized both the OverWorld and UnderWorld."
		],
		"Enre-hep, High Muge": [
			"Enre-hep has the ability to remove unique from any Mugic. He combos well with expensive Mugic cast from one of his teammates and copying it multiple times for high value. The most broken combo involves Strain of Infection to create a loop to generate infinite counters."
		],
		"Ginar'rash, The Extinguisher": [
			"Similarly to Illusionary Lake, this card can create an inability to have and gain Fire. As long as you play consistent water attacks, your opponent will not be able to play fire attacks."
		],
		"Grounding Grapple": [
			"Grounding Grapple lets you reorder your top three locations, **and** reveal a new location. Unlike the other attacks that reveal a new location, this does not have the cost of losing earth."
		],
		"Headmaster Ankhyja, Seeker of the Art": [
			"Prevents opponent's interaction with your creatures leading to less strategic games. Stunts decks that rely on targeting opponents."
		],
		"Hive Amber": [
			"See Hive Unsung"
		],
		"Hive Unsung": [
			"When combined with Ramarhvir the Hivebringer, Hive Unsung can be used in an infinite combo to allow a one turn win."
		],
		"Hune Paltanin": [
			"She provides massive healing potential to OverWorld decks. Her ability has no cost, so her inclusion in decks is resource advantage and completely counters burn archtypes.",
			"Foxy Waifu"
		],
		"Ikkatosh, The Aich King": [
			"His ability gives significant advantage to cards that were already designed strong to offset their lack of elements. Cards like Aivenna and Anarkiar surpass other fighters with the extraordinary energy and Outperform."
		],
		"Illusionary Lake": [
			"Water is the most common element in the game. This location's preventing the gain of Water ensures a win against any deck that relies on Water.",
			"Water doesn't work here. Your body is 60% water. When Illusionary Lake is revealed, you'll automatically die."
		],
		"Imaginary Walls": [
			"Reducing 10 damage per attack is strong. Even a modest energy M'arrillian or Minion could be able to take 4 or more attacks than usual because of the reduction.\nReturning a Mugic is not a sufficient benefit for the opposing player to counter-act the battle's damage reduction.",
			"Psst, just walk through the wall. It doesn't exist."
		],
		"Interlude of Interruption": [
			"Interlude of Interruption allows OverWorlders to cheaply counter opponents. Because of its low cost, this Mugic is often splashed into mixed decks containing OverWorlders. Since both mixed and OverWorld decks lean towards activated abilities and contain ample Mugic counters, running this Mugic can prevent an opponents strategy without drawback."
		],
		"Lanker": [
			"Lanker grants disciplines on demand. His ability is not limited to once per turn. If you use his ability until he has 5 energy remaining, he can increase stats for at least 5 times ((30-5)/5) per turn. Giving their engaged Creature the ability to prevent your challenges, win initiatives, and any other benefits of obscenely high disciplines.\nA common strategy is to equip Lanker with Kha'rall Husk Armor. So by giving him this additional energy you distribute (30+50-5)/5 x 15 (225) worth of disciplines.",
			"This guy had it coming"
		],
		"Lord Van Bloot, Servant of Aa'une": [
			"Element Attacks are close to half the Attacks in the game, and having a whole deck built around them is common. Other cards remove elements, but Bloot's preventing element gain clause means element decks lose without high courage.",
			"Bowser steals your stars, Lord van Bloot steals your elements.",
			"Its okay, you think, your opponent queued up with a discipline based deck.",
			"His sickle is just compensating"
		],
		"Lore, Ancestral Caller": [
			"Decks that rely on discard interaction, (Danian compost, Mipedian Glost, OverWorld Strain of the Tide, M'arrillian Psi-mageddon, etc.) instantly lose their combo against Lore. Unlike other cards that stiffle discard pile interactions, Lore's ability to gain Mugic counters furthers the disparity in matchups. Additionaly, since Lore has an activated ability on which to spend these counters, has the energy and disciplines of a fighter, and has subtype Muge, the combination of factors pushes him into the overbearing territory and makes Danian burn too powerful.",
			"He was arrested for grave robbery."
		],
		"Lore's Chamber of Recall": [
			"Although this card isn't banworthy in terms of its power level, it limits some deck building and it's banned for the effort to enable more decks."
		],
		"Malvadine, The King's Herald": [
			"His high stats, and ability to defend, make him essential in any mono-Mipedian deck. He has strike and Air 5, which makes him versitile in practically all deck types."
		],
		"Marksman's Preparation": [
			"This card has been talked about for similar reasons to Primal Smash. You can treat it as a 2 Build Point attack that deals 30 Damage and helps you cycle and a 0 Cost that deals 0 Damage and clogs your hand until you draw the other. Despite the downside, its a strong burst of damage and cycling effect for low Build Points."
		],
		"Melody of the Meek": [
			"Taking only 10 damage from every source is brutal. Even with only 30 energy this card would be a big advantage.\nBut there's tons of effects Creatures gain energy - making it difficult to kill a Creature using this Mugic.",
			"See Strike of the Meek"
		],
		"Na-inna": [
			"Na-inna can mess with your opponent by moving Counters from the Creatures that could utilize. But its real benefit is moving Counters to cards that should be limited on Mugic Counters. Combine with a fluidmorpher."
		],
		"Najarin, Fluidmorphers' Foe": [
			"Plenty of card like Heptagon Hail, Chimegrid and Baladeer's Flute allow Najarin to get a plenty of Mugic Counters. Then being able to spend these Counters to give Creatures Energy is strong. This becomes worse When fighting a deck that gains Mugic Counters such as Fluidmorphers.\nBut if that's not bad enough, he shuts down any M'arrillian deck with a built in Refrain of Denial.",
			"Najarin is actually a minion along with Tarterek. Unlike Tarterek who became a Warbeast, and Uksum who became a Kha'rall, Najarin became a fluidmorpher."
		],
		"Najarin's Tower of Song": [
			"Like Tonal Destruction, this card can be abused by Enre-hep to reduce your opponent's Mugic hand. It's an expensive Mugic that doesn't see play anywhere else.",
			"Najarin won the contest for tallest stack of Mugic."
		],
		"Neekwin": [
			"Simply put, Neekwin contains too many good things. He has the build of a fighter (2 elements, relevant disciplines, high energy) while getting \"Untargetable\" and Water 5 when unequipped. Because he's incentivized for not having a Battlegear equipped, he is run with sacrifice gear and when revived automatically gets these benefits. Speaking about revival, he has the subtype \"Mandiblor\", which enables him to be revived through multiple tribe mechanics. Additionally, he benefits from cards that boost Mandiblors. Combined with the many utilities in the Danian tribe, he's a card worthy of his flavor text.",
			"I'm sure you've seen him in a deck by now",
			"Oh you thought this was over?",
			"Neekwin is spelled with **win**",
			"Yeah, I know you're mad about this.",
			"It's in his flavor text..."
		],
		"Numin Voidland": [
			"Discipline supremacy is solidified here. It provides an unfair advantage against decks that rely on elemental attacks for their attack damage.",
			"Your attacks, just like your chances at winning, are now **void**."
		],
		"Psionic Serenade": [
			"This card makes use of an already defeated resource to swing the tempo of a match. High energy minions are already present throughout the meta, giving their decks another tool can make them too strong. Dealing usually 55-65 damage, this all but guarentines a combat win."
		],
		"Primal Smash": [
			"20 Damage for 1 Build Point with no condition is valued far above other Attacks. Competitive decks become better with its inclusion (especially non-elemental based). Decks that would not include it become worse off compared to the competitive ones and deck archtypes like Bodal's Dagger would still remain worse against top tier decks.",
			"Hulk's ***SMASH*** is bigger"
		],
		"Ramarhvir, The Danian Hivebringer": [
			"Ramarhvir, enables Danains resurrection to be it enables Danains resurrection to be too efficient and makes it very difficult to overcome (the game drags on). Combined with Hive Unsung can also be used in an infinite combo to allow a one turn win.",
			"If you have an afternoon to waste, try out the infinite combo.",
			"And you thought Yu-Gi-Oh had grave interaction?"
		],
		"Rao'Pa Sahkk, Condensation Ceremony": [
			"Easily shuts down Mipedian and UnderWorld decks. And hinders many support Creatures in OverWorld and Danian tribes. Being unable to play Mugic or Abilities gives Creatures with Water overwhelming advantage.",
			"*At least Fluidmorphers are having fun at the beach.*"
		],
		"Refrain of Denial": [
			"To shift the meta but giving a wider range of decks access to negation, Refrain of Denial would be switched with Interlude of Interruptions. Having both at the same time could be overbearing."
		],
		"Skeletal Springs": [
			"This location not only prevents Fluidmorphing, but it also acts like Dranakis Threshold for them. The compensation? Water 5. Most players running this location use it in a water deck. So a boost for the player and a potential game breaker for the opponent."
		],
		"Song of Transportation": [
			"Allows you to simply change the opponent's active location to your active location. This card doesn't see much play simply because the overwelming options present in the Mipedian Mugic collection."
		],
		"Strain of Infection": [
			"It allows decks to easily increase their resources and it's an enabler for oppresive combinations, such as building high number of Mugic counters on Lobanne (thanks to Lore, High Muge), or in Danian burn to refuel abilities. Enre-hep, High Muge most breaks this card by creating a loop to generate infinite counters.",
			"Since Danians can turn infected creatures into Mugic counters, I wonder if M'arrillians could turn minions into Mugic counters..."
		],
		"Supercooled Rain": [
			"Removing 4 Mugic Counters severely cripples most decks. Aside from a couple of cards that negate attacks, it is not preventable.",
			"Your opponent didn't need Mugic Counters anyway.",
			"Nothing like a nice super cool shower to wash off the dirt from a hard days work"
		],
		"Talisman of the Mandiblor": [
			"You spend resources taking out their strong Mandiblor fighter, just to have it come back at the price of a support creature. The Creature can be placed anywhere on the board, allowing them to jump next to their opponents support creatures. Additionally, because it can be sacrificed at any time, it can be used to \"skip\" your opponent's turn: after they engage, you activate it and waste their combat and bring back a fighter.",
			"This talisman brings bad luck to any Danian that wears it. But very good luck to mandiblors."
		],
		"Tartarek, Psi Overloader": [
			"On his own a very playable card, two Elements, two very good Disciplines, good Energy and two Mugic Counters.\nOn top of an already good card, his effect lets you easily destroy a play style involving Chieftains.",
			"Tartarek is a Warbeast-like creature without Recklessness. On top of two Mugicians, and a decent Wisdom increasing Ability, he can easily destroy Chieftains. To add insult to injury, Tartarek's Brainwashed ability is the same. His ability is the perfect cover. Who would suspect a guy whose abilities never change?",
			"Chaotic canonically exists in the TMNT universe"
		],
		"Tonal Destruction": [
			"This card is good if you just want to limit your opponent. But gets out of hand when combined with Enre-hep, High Muge or Lore, High Muge by allowing you to strip 4+ of the Mugic from your opponent's hand.",
			"If I can't have Mugic, you can't either."
		],
		"Twister of Elements": [
			"This allows a deck to get away with an unbalanced attack deck. They can focus on multiple high build point attacks without the normal tradeoff of drawing through bad attacks. Additionally, by going through their attack deck faster, they can play the same high damage attacks more times than other decks resulting in a drastic damage inequality.",
			"You would have thought a twister of elements would have used all 4 elements... or at least twisted some elements"
		],
		"Ursis": [
			"A divisive card. Ursis may have no ability (no negative one either), but it does have High Energy, great Power, 3 Mugic counters, and most importantly Creature type Muge.",
			"Stop cheating, Crellan"
		],
		"Vial of Liquid Thought": [
			"Allows the player to take advantage of high build point attacks. With different combinations, the player can spam subsequent high damage.",
			"Did you like that one hit Slash Claw? Want to see it again?",
			"Take a swig of the vial"
		],
		"Xerium Armor": [
			"Against the typical opponent, this Battlegear makes them unable to play their best attacks to maximum damage against big damage decks (like Strike or Element X). With a high Energy Creature, it takes a long time to defeat it.\nThe downsides are it isn't effective against match-ups which do consistent 15-20 Damage attacks, and Battlegear removal/flipping abilities keep it in check.",
			"Taunt needs nerf"
		],
		"Zamool, Lord Van Bloot's Enforcer": [
			"Mugic or Abilities are a key component of gameplay. Zamool removes this from his opponent while still letting his team use them.",
			"His ability is the joke. Right? Oh, just me...",
			"Do you hate your opponent?",
			"You must want the UnderWorld to take over Perim.",
			"Try playing Solitaire when you're bored.",
			"Unlike Chaotic, Solitaire doesn't require an opponent to play.",
			"Did you get bored of playing checkers against yourself and decide to to play Chaotic against yourself?",
			"I heard you wanted to move past the Advanced Apprentice rules, but weren't quite ready for the challenge.",
			"With Zamool's help, Lord Van Bloot will finally conquer the UnderWorld!",
			"You thought that \"Mario Party\" ruined friendships."

		"Primal Smash": "The biggest issue is that the decks that wouldn't benefit from their archetype by using primal are also inherently either low or not even on the tier list because the structure of the better and higher tier meta decks relies on something that isnt just attack value. War beast and strike are worth less than  even a moderately refined deck of wise guys. And while some war beast variant decks lose on primal, wise guys gains. So it would actually create a larger power disparity than already exists. And would reduce deck variety to boot because primal would become an active meta staple to help ensure remaining competitive against other meta decks.\nThe decks that do not benefit from primal already dont have enough going for them to break into higher tiers. Releasing primal does nothing for them. And only hurts them by boosting the power of many decks that are already more competitively viable.",
